# Simple Upload Steps

## The Issue
Railway is deploying from "AcessibleScan" repository but your working code is here in "AccessAuditPro" workspace.

## The Fix (3 minutes)

### Step 1: Download Files
I've prepared a complete file package. Download `AccessAuditPro-complete.tar.gz` from this workspace.

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/rgoodman2/AccessAuditPro
2. Click "uploading an existing file" 
3. Extract and upload all files from the tar.gz
4. Commit changes

### Step 3: Fix Railway
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. In project settings, change source repository from "AcessibleScan" to "AccessAuditPro"
3. Redeploy

## Why This Works
Your server runs perfectly here on port 5000. Once Railway deploys from the correct repository with this exact code, it will work immediately.

## Key Files Railway Needs
- `package.json` (build commands)
- `railway.json` (deployment config)  
- `server/` folder (Express app)
- `client/` folder (React app)
- `shared/` folder (schemas)
