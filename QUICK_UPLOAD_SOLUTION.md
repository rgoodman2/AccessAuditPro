# Quick GitHub Upload Solution

## The Problem
Railway is deploying from "AcessibleScan" but your working code is in "AccessAuditPro". 

## The Solution
Upload the working files to AccessAuditPro repository manually.

## Step 1: Go to GitHub
Visit: https://github.com/rgoodman2/AccessAuditPro

## Step 2: Upload Key Files
Click "Add file" > "Upload files" and drag these files:

**Root files:**
- package.json (contains build commands Railway needs)
- railway.json (Railway deployment config)
- README.md (project description)
- vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts, theme.json, tsconfig.json
- drizzle.config.ts, postcss.config.js
- .gitignore

## Step 3: Create Folders
Create these folders and upload their contents:
- client/ (React frontend)
- server/ (Express backend) 
- shared/ (TypeScript schemas)

## Step 4: Reconnect Railway
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Change source from "AcessibleScan" to "AccessAuditPro"
3. Deploy

## Why This Will Work
This exact code runs successfully in this workspace (server on port 5000). Once Railway deploys from the correct repository, it will work immediately.
